# s3yum

## Introduction
A tool for maintaining private yum repos in s3 allowing access via a smart proxy 
A 3rd-party plugin that makes private S3 repos accessible can be found here: https://github.com/seporaitis/yum-s3-iam

## Overview

 * A developer with AWS credentials places a set of RPMs in a local directory.
 * The developer uses s3yum to maintain a copy of the RPMs in a bucket in S3; corresponding yum metadata is transparently maintained by s3yum.
 * The S3 bucket is private; access is allowed using signed URL's/IAM credentials.
 * The developer creates an IAM role and adds a policy allowing access to the S3 bucket.
 * Instances started with that role may use it to sign requests for bucket access.
 * A config file is deployed to /etc/yum/repos.d on the instance which directs yum to the S3 bucket.
 * The download then completes using the URL with temporary access credentials appended in the query string of the URI.

## Usage
The general format of an s3yum command is

    s3yum ACTION [OPTIONS] [RPM1] [RPM2] ... [RPM2]
    
Where ACTION is one of:
 * **create**: create a new yum repo
 * **get**: copy the entirety of a given repo to a local directory
 * **list**: list repo contents
 * **help**: provide help for a given action
 * **update**: update a yum repo by adding or deleting rpm's

For detailed usage, try the following:
 * s3yum --help - display general command line usage
 * s3yum help - display available commands

#### Example 1: Create a new repo from a set of RPM's
    s3yum CREATE -v \
        -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg1.rpm my_pkg2.rpm

#### Example 2: Adding a new RPM to a repo:
    s3yum UPDATE -v \
        -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg3.rpm

#### Example 3: Downloading an entire repo, including repo metadata:
    s3yum GET -v \
        -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -o my_repo_dir
 
#### Example 4: Deleting an entire repo:
    s3yum DELETE -v \
        -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path/'
