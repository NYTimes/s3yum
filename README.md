## Overview

 * A developer with AWS credentials places a set of RPMs in a local directory.
 * The developer uses s3yum to maintain a copy of the RPMs in a bucket in S3;
   corresponding yum metadata is transparently maintained by s3yum.
 * The S3 bucket is private; access is allowed via signed URL's/IAM.
 * The developer creates an IAM role and adds a policy allowing
   access to the S3 bucket.
 * Instances started with that role may use it to sign requests
   for bucket access.
 * A config file is deployed to /etc/yum/repos.d on the instance which directs
   yum to the S3 bucket.


## Build and Installation
```Shell
# Install dependencies:
pip2.7 install -r ./requirements.txt
python2.7 ./setup.py install

# For more info (packaging, etc):
python2.7 ./setup.py --help-commands
```

## Development
:warning: As of version [1.6.4](https://github.com/nytimes/s3yum/releases/tag/v1.6.4),
s3yum is still developed with _python2.7_ - any future major releases will
be ported to python3.

```Shell
# Install additional development dependencies:
pip2.7 install -r dev-requirements.txt

# If you don't have virtualenv (python2.7):
pip2.7 install virtualenv

# If you already have virtualenv for a different python version:
virtualenv -p $( which python2.7 ) venv

# Source your virtual environment:
source ./venv/bin/activate

# Run tests:
nosetests -v

# If additional dependencies are added:
pip2.7 freeze > ./requirements.txt

# Deactivate when done:
deactivate
```

## Usage
The general format of an s3yum command is
`s3yum ACTION [OPTIONS] [RPM1] [RPM2] ... [RPM2]`
    
Where ACTION is one of:
 * `create`: create a new yum repo
 * `get`: copy the entirety of a given repo to a local directory
 * `list`: list repo contents
 * `help`: provide help for a given action
 * `update`: update a yum repo by adding or deleting rpm's

For detailed usage, try the following:
 * s3yum --help - display general command line usage
 * s3yum help - display available commands

### Environment Variables
 * `CREATEREPO` - path to 'createrepo' executable
 * `AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE` - path to credential file for AWS auth
 * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - aws access key
 * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - aws secrety key

### Authentication
There are three main ways you can autenticate using s3yum:
 * Using environment variables, as described above
 * Using a [boto config](http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html)
 * By [assuming a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html) using `--asume-role`

### Upload/Download Semantics
Unless `--force-upload` or `--force-download` is specifed, s3yum uses the
following criteria to decide whether or not to upload or download a file:
 - If the source file does not exist at the destination: transfer
 - If the source file does exist at the destination, and the checksums of
   source and destination are different: transfer if the mtime of the source
   is greater than the mtime of the destination
 - If the source file exists at the destination and the checksums match:
   don't transfer the file.

### Examples
#### Example 1: Create a new repo from a set of RPM's
```Shell
s3yum CREATE -v \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg1.rpm my_pkg2.rpm
```

#### Example 2: Adding a new RPM to a repo:
```Shell
s3yum UPDATE -v \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg3.rpm
```

#### Example 3: Adding a new RPM to a repo, saving a copy on the local disk for re-use:
```Shell
s3yum UPDATE -v \
    -w ./my_local_path \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg4.rpm

# This time, nothing new is downloaded and only my_pkg5.rpm and the
# new repodata will get uploaded!
s3yum UPDATE -v \
    -w ./my_local_path \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path' my_pkg5.rpm
```

#### Example 4: Downloading an entire repo, including repo metadata:
```Shell
s3yum GET -v \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -o my_repo_dir
```
 
#### Example 5: Deleting an entire repo:
```Shell
s3yum DELETE -v \
    -b my_bucket.amazon.s3.com -p '/my_path/'
```
